     <h2>Times I've had Portuguese Egg Tarts</h2>
     <p>
       I pretty much get a box of portuguese egg tarts every month from a bakery called Lily Bloom Bakery, which is popular for it's egg tarts. Everytime I go there to get a box, they're either sold out or fresh from the oven.

     <p>
       What makes their bakery better than other bakeries that sell portuguese egg tarts is the amount of filling they put. Most chinese bakeries that make portuguese egg tarts are small, dry, and don't have enough filling. In this case, this is the opposite for Lily Bloom Bakery, where the filling to crust ratio is much higher than others. As you can tell, I'm a big fan of them and hope that one day, I too can make my own portuguese egg tart.
