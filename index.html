     <h2>History</h2>
     <p>Portuguese egg tarts are delcious. It is a chinese pastry and is one of the most popular pastries in most chinese bakeries. But what is it?</p>
     <p>Well, it's a egg pastry with a flaky crust, a sweet, warm, and creamy inside, and has a layer of semi-burnt filling at the top, giving it its signature look.</p>
     <p>They were supposedly first made in the 13th century by monks in the Jer√≥nimos Monastery in Lisbon. Legend says the monks had been based in France, where they learned of delectable pastries, and that they needed a way to use up the yolks separated from the egg whites that were used to starch clothing.</p>

     <h2>Why it's unique</h2>
     <p>The main difference between a portuguese egg tart, and a normal hong kong style egg tart is the texture. The texture of a normal egg tart is more solid and jelly like, whereas the portuguese egg tart is mushier and creamier. The portuguese egg tart has a charred top layer while the normal egg tart does not. The crust of a portuguese egg tart is also flakier, lighter, and is made of puff pastry. In contrast,
       the normal egg tart is crumblier, stiffer, and is made of shortcrust casing.</p>
       <p>Nonetheless, both are still very tasy and should be tried at least once in your lifetime, but for now, this website will mostly be talking about how to make the portuguese egg tart.</p>
